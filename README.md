# Nokia Keypad Converter

## Project Overview
The Nokia Keypad Converter is a web-based application that allows users to convert between old Nokia-style numeric keypad input and corresponding letter representations. Users can input numbers as they would on a classic Nokia device and receive the associated letters, or vice versa. The application leverages JavaScript for logic and uses Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a modern and user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Convert numbers (e.g., 2, 22, 222) to letters (e.g., a, b, c).
- Convert letters (e.g., a, b, c) to numbers (e.g., 2, 22, 222).
- Clean and responsive UI designed with Tailwind CSS.
- Intuitive interaction via buttons for easy switching between conversions.

## Installation
To set up the Nokia Keypad Converter locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nokia-keypad-converter.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd nokia-keypad-converter
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html  # For macOS
   xdg-open index.html  # For Ubuntu

   ```

## Usage
1. Enter your input in the designated text area.
2. Click the **Numbers to Letters** button to convert numbers to their corresponding letters.

4. The converted output will automatically display in the output text area.
